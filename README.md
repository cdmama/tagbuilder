# Tag Builder ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

Tag Builder is a simple web app to create HTML tags. See it in action at [tagbuilder.xyz](http://tagbuilder.xyz).

## Motivation

I'm currently learning Go and this is my first web application using it. The idea of a tag builder application came to me when a few friends asked for help on how to put links on their Tumblr sites. Creating HTML code can still be daunting for others, so I thought of making an app where you could input the relevant details, and get the HTML code.

## Built with
* Go - backend
* Vue.js - frontend

[tagbuilder.xyz](http://tagbuilder.xyz) is hosted on Google Cloud.
